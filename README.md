# Pluralsight - Python Flask Apps
_May 2016_

**From the course: _Introduction to the Flask Microframework_**

_By Reindert-Jan Ekker_

This repo contains two of the sample apps that I created by following the above Pluralsight course. The course is highly recommended and a great beginners course into web development using python.

Each commit relates to a module from the course so you can follow along from any stage.

Step by step details for the installation and setup of the environment is avalible in the first two modules of the Pluralsight course.

_However if your not following the video, here are the **environment details**:_

_(Just google the installation for your platform)_

**Requires:**
- python 2.7
- pip (python package manager which should install with python)
- flask

You can install flask as is however its not recommended to install flask globally. Instead the following tools can be used to create isolated python environmen and are used in this Pluralsight course:
* virtualenv
* virtualenvwrapper
